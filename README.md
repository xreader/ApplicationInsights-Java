2.  To build run ./gradlew build on Linux systems or gradlew.bat build on Windows systems.

Using Eclipse IDE
-----------------

CollectD Plugin - Optional
--------------------------
To build Application Insights CollectD writer plugin, please do the following:

1.  Download CollectD Java API sources and compile them using JDK 1.6.
    The output jar should be named: 'collectd-api.jar'.
    More info on compiling CollectD sources can be found here: https://collectd.org/dev-info.shtml
2.  Create a new directory for CollectD library you just created, and set a new environment variable 'COLLECTD_HOME'
    pointing to that folder.   
3.  Copy the new jar into %COLLECTD_HOME%/lib
4.  Reload Application Insights project. CollectD writer plugin sub-project should now be loaded.
    IDE restart may be required in order to identify the new environment variable.

Notes
